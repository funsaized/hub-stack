## 2026-08-10 — Phase 0: baseline and executable specification

Status: ready for Phase 0 review; production behavior is unchanged.

Scope selected:

- Phase 0 only, because the PRD defines it as the first gated unit of work.
- No Phase 1 schema or ingestion changes were made.
- No research jobs, crawls, embeddings, or Qdrant upserts were launched.

Baseline captured before edits:

- Git 2.54.0 is installed at the Hermes-managed path
  `C:\Users\saigu\AppData\Local\hermes\git\cmd\git.exe`. The initial sandboxed command
  could not resolve or inspect that external path; a direct approved invocation confirmed
  `git status --short --branch` reports `## main`. No reset, checkout, or other operation
  that could disturb pre-existing work was performed.
- Existing synthesis suite: 3 tests passed in 0.129 seconds.
- Existing full Research Hub suite: 58 tests passed in 0.648 seconds with no skips,
  using the application image mounted at `/app` and Compose Redis database 15.

Executable specifications added:

- `test_relevant_evidence_after_long_prefix_is_used` retains a unique sentinel after a
  prefix longer than the current synthesis excerpt allocation and supplies a deterministic
  mocked retrieval hit for that sentinel. It is expected to fail until report synthesis
  consumes retrieved chunks instead of document prefixes.
- `test_unchanged_document_remains_visible_to_every_observing_job` records the same
  canonical document for two jobs and expects both jobs to retain access. It is expected
  to fail while `documents.job_id` is mutable exclusive ownership.
- `test_existing_database_backfills_historical_job_observation` simulates an existing
  pre-`job_sources` database, reopens it twice, and expects an idempotent observation
  backfill. It is expected to fail until the Phase 1 migration exists.

Phase 0 gate evidence:

- The late-evidence test fails with: `retrieved late-evidence sentinel was absent from
  the generation prompt`.
- The cross-job reuse test fails because Job A returns `[]` after Job B saves the same
  document, instead of retaining `doc-1`.
- The legacy migration test fails because `job_sources` is absent after two store
  initializations.
- The complete post-specification suite runs 61 tests: the 58 baseline tests still pass,
  and exactly the three new executable specifications fail as expected.

Next proposed work (not started): Phase 1 — immutable job/source observations.

## 2026-08-10 — Phase 1: immutable job/source observations

Status: ready for Phase 1 review; Phase 2 scoped retrieval and Phase 3 synthesis changes
were not started.

Pre-edit checks:

- `git status --short --branch` reported `## main` and the existing modification to
  this progress file. That change was preserved and this entry was appended.
- The three Phase 0 specifications failed for the documented reasons: Job A lost
  `doc-1`, the legacy database had no `job_sources` table, and the late-evidence
  sentinel was absent from the synthesis prompt.
- After direct-store tests were changed to use the explicit observation API, the new
  tests failed before production edits because `observe_job_source` did not exist and
  ingestion did not call it.

Files changed:

- `research-hub/app/document_store.py`: added the idempotent `job_sources` table and
  `(document_id, job_id)` index, deterministic legacy backfill, explicit observation
  upsert, non-transferring canonical saves, and observation-joined job reads.
- `research-hub/app/research.py`: records each job/source observation immediately after
  retaining the canonical document and before the unchanged-document fast path.
- `research-hub/tests/test_documents_and_batches.py`: uses explicit observations and
  verifies two-job retention, one canonical row, two observations, legacy timestamp and
  metadata backfill, index creation, and repeated-initialization idempotency.
- `research-hub/tests/test_ingestion_idempotency.py`: verifies unchanged ingestion records
  its observation without embedding.
- `research-hub/tests/test_synthesis.py`: direct fixtures now use the explicit observation
  API; synthesis and public behavior are otherwise unchanged.
- `PRDs/research-rag-synthesis-modernization-progress.md`: recorded this Phase 1 gate.

Test outputs (application container mounted at `/app`, Compose Redis database 15):

- Observation plus ingestion-idempotency gate: 11 tests passed in 0.128 seconds.
- Existing synthesis lifecycle gate: 3 tests passed in 0.137 seconds.
- Complete suite: 62 tests ran in 0.785 seconds; 61 passed with no skips and exactly one
  expected failure, `test_relevant_evidence_after_long_prefix_is_used`. All four Redis
  worker integration tests ran and passed.
- The expected remaining failure still reports: `retrieved late-evidence sentinel was
  absent from the generation prompt`. It belongs to Phase 3.
- The repository CRLF-aware `git diff --check` completed with exit code 0 and no
  whitespace errors.

Phase 1 acceptance:

- Existing document rows remain readable and `documents.job_id` remains present.
- An unchanged version retains one canonical Markdown row while Job A and Job B each
  retain an immutable association to it.
- Canonical saves no longer transfer the legacy `documents.job_id` owner.
- `documents_for_job(job_id)` reads through `job_sources` in stable canonical URL and
  document ID order, so older-job report lookup still finds the reused source.
- Legacy rows backfill from `fetched_at` with `created_at` as a deterministic fallback,
  preserve research metadata, and repeated initialization does not duplicate rows.
- Ingestion observes sources before checking whether embedding can be skipped.
- No public API, retrieval, report synthesis, crawl, embedding, Qdrant data, job, commit,
  or push was changed or launched.

Remaining risks:

- A legacy database can recover only the single association still present in
  `documents.job_id`; associations overwritten before this migration cannot be inferred.
- Qdrant job/topic payloads remain historical and mutable in meaning. Phase 2 must scope
  retrieval through SQLite observations rather than those payload fields.

Next proposed work (not started): Phase 2 — scoped retrieval domain service, after Phase
1 review approval.
