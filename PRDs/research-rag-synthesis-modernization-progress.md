## 2026-08-10 — Phase 0: baseline and executable specification

Status: ready for Phase 0 review; production behavior is unchanged.

Scope selected:

- Phase 0 only, because the PRD defines it as the first gated unit of work.
- No Phase 1 schema or ingestion changes were made.
- No research jobs, crawls, embeddings, or Qdrant upserts were launched.

Baseline captured before edits:

- Host `git status --short --branch` could not run because `git` is not installed or
  available on `PATH` in the host PowerShell environment. No reset, checkout, or other
  operation that could disturb pre-existing work was performed.
- Existing synthesis suite: 3 tests passed in 0.129 seconds.
- Existing full Research Hub suite: 58 tests passed in 0.648 seconds with no skips,
  using the application image mounted at `/app` and Compose Redis database 15.

Executable specifications added:

- `test_relevant_evidence_after_long_prefix_is_used` retains a unique sentinel after a
  prefix longer than the current synthesis excerpt allocation and supplies a deterministic
  mocked retrieval hit for that sentinel. It is expected to fail until report synthesis
  consumes retrieved chunks instead of document prefixes.
- `test_unchanged_document_remains_visible_to_every_observing_job` records the same
  canonical document for two jobs and expects both jobs to retain access. It is expected
  to fail while `documents.job_id` is mutable exclusive ownership.
- `test_existing_database_backfills_historical_job_observation` simulates an existing
  pre-`job_sources` database, reopens it twice, and expects an idempotent observation
  backfill. It is expected to fail until the Phase 1 migration exists.

Phase 0 gate evidence:

- The late-evidence test fails with: `retrieved late-evidence sentinel was absent from
  the generation prompt`.
- The cross-job reuse test fails because Job A returns `[]` after Job B saves the same
  document, instead of retaining `doc-1`.
- The legacy migration test fails because `job_sources` is absent after two store
  initializations.
- The complete post-specification suite runs 61 tests: the 58 baseline tests still pass,
  and exactly the three new executable specifications fail as expected.

Next proposed work (not started): Phase 1 — immutable job/source observations.
